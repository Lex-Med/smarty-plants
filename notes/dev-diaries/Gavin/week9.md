I haven't done anything this week, but going forward we will be looking to integrate parts of the program which were worked on in previous weeks. DP edit distance is done and byte vec may be ready to use. Dominic emailed Ukkonnen and got help confirming that the suffix tree is correct. Suffix links were confirmed to be just a part of the construction algorithm and an algorithm other than Ukkonen's would be needed to deduplicate. We don't know an algorithm for doing this and it's likely to be very complex, so we may skip this and instead use other workarounds like disk-swapping, or making smaller suffix trees from fragments of the transcriptome (overlapping so that reads don't get cut off).
